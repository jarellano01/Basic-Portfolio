# Basic Portfolio
This was one of my first attempts at creating a basic portfolio website using just HTML and CSS. 

This website was just a basic html template for testing out various html features such as responsiveness with CSS. Feel free to look at the code as it is quite clean and works well for a basic template. This is also a good example as to how to create a sticky footer. 

## Live Website
